Description:

Vinyl maps is a search engine for vinyl music records. Itâ€™s created as part of a 2nd year Web-app coursework module. Vinylmap crawls the web and finds newly released records, aggregating the results and making them easily searchable and purchasable by users from a multitude of stores. Users can find records, a link to its store page and quickly view its price.
